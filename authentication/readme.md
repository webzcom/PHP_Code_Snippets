## Important Notes:

This example uses hard-coded username and password for simplicity. 

In a real-world application, you should retrieve and validate credentials against a database securely using prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.
Passwords should be stored in a hashed format. 

PHP provides functions like password_hash() for creating hashes and password_verify() for verifying passwords against hashes.

Always ensure that session management is done securely, by using secure, HTTP-only cookies, and regenerating session IDs upon login using session_regenerate_id().

For added security, consider implementing CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) tokens in your form submissions and using HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.

This example provides a basic framework. Remember, building a secure authentication system requires careful consideration of security practices at every step.
