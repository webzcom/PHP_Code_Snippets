## This script does the following:

- Establishes a connection to the database using PDO.
- Checks if the registration form has been submitted.
- Sanitizes and validates the input data (you might want to add more validation based on your requirements).
- Hashes the password using password_hash.
- Prepares an SQL statement to insert the new user into the database, binding the username and hashed password as parameters.
- Executes the prepared statement and checks for errors.
- Please replace 'your_database_name', 'your_database_username', and 'your_database_password' with your actual database name, username, and password.
- Also, ensure your PHP environment is properly configured to use PDO with MySQL.


Remember, this is a basic example for educational purposes. A real-world application should include more comprehensive error handling, validation (e.g., to ensure username uniqueness), and security measures (e.g., using HTTPS to protect form data in transit).
